                <h1>Positive Racism? What?</h1>
                <div class="blog-detail">Posted on <span><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-racist-but-is-often-regarded-as-not-racist/answer/Ali-Azhar-7">Quora</a></span> - 22 May 2018</span>  </div>
            
                <div class="blog-content">
                    
                    <p>
                        <blockquote>
                        </blockquote>
                        I have seen so many people online labelling ‘positive racism' as racism. To those who don't know, positive racism means associating a race with a positive quality.<br/>
                        But this isn't racism. Racism is defined as:
                        <blockquote>
                            “prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior”
                        </blockquote>
                        The whole problem of racism is that it considers people of other race as inferior to oneself. By saying Indians are good at coding, I'm not degrading them in anyway. Of course it's a generalization and it's not correct. But it's not racist under any conventional meaning of the word.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Stretching the meaning of a word to make it more politically correct just diminishes the significance of the actual meaning. Racism is bad because our collective consciousness considers it unjust. We are denying someone of their right on the basis of something over which they have no control. Calling someone good at something, even if they are not, is not unjust in anyway (again I'm using the conventional meaning of unjust, not some stretched up meaning that you might have in your mind).
                        <br/><br/>
                        If someone told me that believing Indians are better coders in general is racism and had this been the only definition of racism that I had known, I wouldn't have given a damn about their cause against racism because frankly I would consider it obnoxious complaining. They are just making an issue out of nothing. Even worse, it would make me less sensitive to not only the word racism but to the actual act of racism as well.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If you want to argue that labeling them good coders limits Indians to being employed in other fields then this is simply not true (or in more 'politcally correct' words, not related). It wasn't positive racism that made a racist employer think “Nah, I don't wanna hire an Indian for a managerial position.” It's a case of actual, conventional racism. The employer wouldn't have hired that person, even if they never had the reputation of being good coders.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Anyway, I hope you get what I'm trying to say. Needless sensationalization just diverts the attention from the actual problems.
                        <br/><br/>
