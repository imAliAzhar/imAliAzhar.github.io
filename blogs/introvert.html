                    <p>
                        <blockquote>
                        </blockquote>
                        Do you find yourself lost on how to strike a conversation with strangers?
                        <br/><br/>
                        You can try doing what I do.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This applies mostly when talking with someone with whom you are not that close with. The idea is not to let them know that you are an introvert. And try to maintain this image. At least for as long as possible.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If you are like me I'm pretty sure you hate small talk just as much. But small talk can be very predictable. Depending upon the person or the situation, you can often predict how the conversation is going to flow. For example, the most common questions are:
                        <blockquote>
                            What are you doing these days?
                            <br/>
                            How's your family?
                            <br/>
                            How's the weather back there?
                            <br/>
                            How are your studies going?
                       </blockquote>

                        Now here's the trick, you have to answer these questions before they are asked.
                        <br/><br/>
                        You think someone is going to ask you about your studies? Start talking about your boring teachers or bitch about your grades. But don't let them ask you this question. Because once they ask a question, subconsciously they will feel they have done their part of continuing this conversation and now the burden is on you. Don't give them a chance to ask and instead, once you have answered that unasked question, ask something from them now. And now the burden shifts to them.
                        <br/><br/>
                        And remember, you always have something to tell but being an introvert, you just don't feel like you need to tell those things. Everyone has a story. You have your own routine, your own problems, you have your own opinions about the world, you have your own dreams. You are living your own story. Share it with them.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It can be as simple as just reciting what you did today or what you plan to do tomorrow. Be as detailed as possible. Drag it as much as you can.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Start a random discussion about a topic of your interest. You do have an interest. If you think you don't have one then you just haven't given it a proper thought. What is that you watch on YouTube in your free time? That's one of your interests. What do you read the most about on internet? That's another of your interests.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Discuss what was on the news last night. This is one of the easiest way to kick start a conversation. If still nothing works, make fun of your lack of ability to talk. This one always work and let's the other know of your struggle.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Don't let the fear of making a conversation get to you. Stay calm and relaxed. Keep in mind, there's silence only when not only you but also they are not saying anything.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If you just try to be more talkative in the start you can avoid being labelled as boring or silent. Later on, you can let the other person to do most of the talking and you can just give remarks here and there.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This can be helpful when talking to acquaintances. But this might not work when sitting in a group of friends where there's already a flow of conversation. You can try tuning in to that if that conversation interests you or you can try starting talking about your own interest when there's silence.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Remember that it's okay to feel like not saying anything. Don't pressurize yourself to talk. Your close friends will understand you. And those who don't, you don't need to impress them. Make an excuse and leave. Do what makes you comfortable.
